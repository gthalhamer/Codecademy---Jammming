# Jammming React Project

In this multipart Codecademy project, I created a React app to search for songs using the Spotify API. 

Hereâ€™s a quick overview of the key functions for this app:
  - Ability to search for and view songs from the Spotify library based on song title, artist, album, or keyword
  - Add songs to custom playlist
  - Save the custom playlist to a Spotify account
  

This project was completed as part of the Codecademy Web Development career path: https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/web-development.
